A demo that showcases the snapshotting capabilities can be found
[here [1]](https://code.amazon.com/packages/Wisp-demo/trees/mainline/--/).

The demo showcases two usage cases:
1. a simple case of pausing a live microVM to a snapshot, then resuming
that guest in a different Firecracker process by loading the snapshot,
2. a case where multiple clones are started from a single snapshot.
